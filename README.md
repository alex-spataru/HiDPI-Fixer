# HiDPI Fixer
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/alex-spataru/HiDPI-Fixer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alex-spataru/HiDPI-Fixer) 

This application allows you to create a script that acomplishes the following tasks:
- Allow fractional scaling of your display and its components in X11
- The end result looks nicer and is way less buggy than using Wayland
- The generated script is configured to run everytime you log in
- You can also instruct the application to modify the `~/.profile` file to correctly scale Qt-based apps (as KDE does)
- Tested on GNOME, Deepin Desktop and KDE (you need to manualy set the scaling factor to 200% in Deepin and KDE)

## Installing/running

You can [download](https://github.com/alex-spataru/HiDPI-Fixer/releases/latest) the latest release as an AppImage, no installation required!
After your download finishes, open a terminal and type the following commands:

    cd Downloads                    # Go to directory where you have downloaded/saved HiDPI-Fixer
    chmod +x HiDPI_Fixer*.AppImage  # Make HiDPI-Fixer.AppImage executable
    ./HiDPI_Fixer*.AppImage         # Run HiDPI-Fixer
    
### Uninstalling

To remove all the scripts and startup launchers generated by HiDPI Fixer, open a terminal and type the following:

    cd Downloads                         # Or the location in which you have saved HiDPI-Fixer AppImage
    ./HiDPI_Fixer*.AppImage --uninstall  # Run uninstall command (if you are lazy, just type -u)
    
This command will do the following:
- Remove the `~/.hidpi-fixer` directory and all its contents
- Remove all the startup applications with the name pattern as `HiDPI-Fixer_*.desktop` in the `~/.config/autostart` directory.

All directories and files that HiDPI Fixer removes will be listed in the terminal output.

## How does it work?

This application uses a combination of GNOME's `scaling-factor` setting and `xrandr` commands. Basically, the application calculates the necessary resolution to obtain the desired scaling factor and registers a new resolution with Xrandr. These commands are saved into a `*.sh` file for every display that you have and are configured to run at startup.
